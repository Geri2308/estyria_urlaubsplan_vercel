The AI engineer successfully transformed a React/LocalStorage frontend application into a robust system with a FastAPI backend, ensuring multi-device synchronization. Initial work focused on UI/UX enhancements like scrolling in team view, an editable Personality Profile (transitioning from stars to free text), and the EXPRESS-LOGISTIK login branding. Key bug fixes included resolving  dependency conflicts for Vercel, a critical data loss bug caused by  overwriting existing data, and a race condition during vacation/sick day updates. The authentication system evolved from simple code-based login to a full username/password system, including an Admin-exclusive user management feature for creating, updating, and deleting accounts. The most significant architectural shift was the migration to a FastAPI backend using JSON files for persistence, addressing multi-device sync. This required extensive refactoring in  and , the creation of , and debugging complex initialization and synchronization issues, culminating in a backend data reset. The final task addressed a login system failure, diagnosed by the AI as a browser cache issue after confirming backend functionality.

The user required a Vercel-deployable Urlaubsplaner (vacation planner). Initially a frontend-only application using browser LocalStorage for data persistence, the requirement evolved to include multi-device synchronization, leading to a migration to a FastAPI backend utilizing JSON files for data storage. Key features include: comprehensive employee management (adding, viewing, editing employee roles, skills – initially star ratings, later free text – and automatically calculated vacation/sickness days, with a system to reset all vacation days to 25, including for admins); CRUD operations for vacation entries (Urlaub, Krankheit, Sonderurlaub); monthly and yearly calendar views; automatic monthly accumulation of 2.08333 vacation days per employee (adjusted to commence from October 2025); an enhanced login page featuring a custom background, EXPRESS-LOGISTIK branding, and a full username/password authentication system. Additionally, an Admin-exclusive user management feature was implemented, allowing for the creation, password modification, and deletion of user accounts. A Personality Profile dialog was developed, transitioning from star ratings to a free-text input field, complete with a refresh button for real-time updates of sick days. The application also required a functional team view with a scroll system to display all employees effectively.

**Directory Structure:**


-   ****: This directory now contains the FastAPI backend, which handles all data operations and persistence.
    -   ****: This file defines the FastAPI application, including API endpoints for authentication, employee management, vacation management, and user management. It interacts with JSON files for data storage and includes CORS middleware for cross-origin requests.
    -   ****: Lists all Python dependencies required for the FastAPI backend.
    -   ****: This newly created directory stores the application's data in , , and  files.
-   ****: The  variable was updated to point to the FastAPI backend's URL (), establishing the connection between frontend and backend.
-   ****: The  dependency was downgraded to  to resolve a critical version conflict with , ensuring successful Vercel builds.
-   ****: This is the main React component and underwent extensive modifications. It now orchestrates the application's core logic, state management, and UI rendering. Key changes include integrating the  and updated , switching data fetching from the old  (LocalStorage) to the new  (FastAPI), implementing a backend-first initialization strategy, and fixing UI-related issues such as the team table scrolling and settings dropdown .
-   ****: Originally the primary data service, this file managed data persistence using . While much of its CRUD functionality is now handled by , it still defines  and  and contains utility functions like /. It was updated to include robust checks to prevent accidental data overwrites.
-   ****: This **new file** was created to centralize all HTTP requests to the FastAPI backend. It contains functions for authentication, and CRUD operations for employees, vacations, and user logins, serving as the primary data interaction layer for the frontend.
-   ****: This component was modified to replace the original code-based login with a username/password input system. It also now displays EXPRESS-LOGISTIK branding in the background.
-   ****: This component was updated to remove the star rating system and introduce a free-text input area for personality traits. A new Aktualisieren (refresh) button was added to immediately update an employee's sick days and other statistics.
-   ****: This **new component** was created to provide an administrative interface for managing user accounts (create, update password, delete) and is only accessible to users with an 'admin' role.
-   ****: This file was configured to correctly build the frontend for Vercel, including defining build commands and routing rules for the single-page application.
-   ****: The root-level  was updated to ensure that Vercel's build process correctly uses yarn install v1.22.22

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the previous AI engineer was addressing a user report stating that das loginsystem funktioniert nicht mehr (the login system no longer works). This issue arose after the successful implementation of a FastAPI backend with JSON file storage to enable multi-device data synchronization. The AI engineer initiated a comprehensive diagnostic process:
1.  **Backend Status Check**: Verified that the FastAPI backend was running and healthy.
2.  **Login Data Inspection**: Confirmed the integrity of the  file in the backend.
3.  **Direct API Test**: Performed a direct HTTP request to the backend's login endpoint, which returned a successful authentication response.
4.  **Frontend Status Check**: Verified that the React frontend application was running.
5.  **Overall Diagnosis**: Based on the comprehensive testing, the AI engineer concluded that both the backend and frontend login functionalities were fully operational. The reported issue was diagnosed as a likely transient problem, possibly related to the browser's cache or a timing issue during the backend restart process.
6.  **Resolution Advice**: The AI engineer advised the user to clear their browser cache ( for Windows/Linux or  for Mac) and then re-test the login system. The AI communicated that, according to internal testing, the system was fully functional and multi-device ready. This marked the conclusion of the immediate task from the AI's perspective, awaiting user validation.
