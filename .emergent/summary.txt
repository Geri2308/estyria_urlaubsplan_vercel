The AI engineer's work primarily revolved around stabilizing and enhancing a React/FastAPI application. Initially, the focus was on migrating a LocalStorage-based React frontend to a FastAPI backend for multi-device synchronization, involving extensive debugging of connectivity and authentication issues. This included fixing HTTP 404s, Failed to fetch errors due to incorrect backend URLs (localhost, internal IPs, preview domains), and establishing proxy configurations for development. A significant challenge was the Invalid Host header issue during local development, resolved by disabling host checks.

Later, the project shifted to addressing Vercel deployment issues, specifically the Failed to fetch error due to Vercel hosting only the frontend. The solution involved implementing a robust backend detection system with a LocalStorage fallback. This led to a multi-backend strategy, attempting to deploy the FastAPI backend on Render.com for true multi-device synchronization. This phase encountered multiple Render deployment errors (Python dependency conflicts, permission issues for data directory) and Vercel environment variable misconfigurations.

The most recent and persistent bug involved user authentication: new users couldn't log in, and multi-device sync wasn't working. This was traced to a series of errors, including incorrect API parameter formatting, faulty frontend response parsing, an outdated Render backend, and most critically, the frontend using an incorrect, hardcoded preview backend URL for login instead of the deployed Render backend URL. The AI engineer attempted to fix these one by one, with the user continuously reporting the problem persists. The last action was the AI engineer preparing for a fresh, systematic debug.

<product_requirements>
The Urlaubsplaner (vacation planner) application was initially a frontend-only React app using browser LocalStorage for data. The core requirement evolved to include multi-device synchronization, necessitating a FastAPI backend with JSON file persistence. Key features developed include:
-   **Employee Management**: CRUD operations for employees, including roles, free-text personality profiles (replacing star ratings), automatic calculation of vacation and sick days, and a reset function for 25 vacation days.
-   **Vacation Management**: CRUD operations for various types of leave (Urlaub, Krankheit, Sonderurlaub).
-   **Calendar Views**: Monthly and yearly views to visualize employee availability.
-   **Automated Vacation Accrual**: Monthly accumulation of 2.08333 vacation days per employee, starting October 2025.
-   **Enhanced Login System**: A custom EXPRESS-LOGISTIK branded login page with a full username/password authentication system.
-   **Admin User Management**: An exclusive feature for administrators to create, update (password), and delete user accounts. This feature was later secured to be Admin-only.
-   **UI/UX Enhancements**: Scrolling in the team view, refresh button in the personality profile dialog.
-   **Deployment**: Vercel deployment capability for the frontend.
-   **Multi-Device Synchronization**: The most significant recent requirement, aiming for seamless data sync across devices using the FastAPI backend hosted on Render.com, with a LocalStorage fallback for frontend-only deployments.

<pending_tasks>
-   Address the ongoing issue where newly created users cannot log in, as reported by the user in the latest message.
-   Investigate the current state of frontend-backend communication after the latest changes to ensure that the correct backend URL is consistently used for both user creation and login.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the previous AI engineer was attempting to resolve a persistent bug where newly created users could not log in, despite multiple fixes and verifications. The latest root cause identified by a  was that the frontend was inconsistently using two different backend URLs: the correct Render.com URL for user creation, but an old preview URL () for the login attempt itself.

To address this, the AI engineer made the following changes:
-   **File**: 
-   **Change**: Modified  from  to  (the Render backend URL). This was intended to unify the backend URL used by the frontend.
-   **Expected Outcome**: With both user creation and login attempts targeting the same, correct Render backend URL, new users should now be able to log in successfully, and multi-device synchronization should be fully operational.

The AI engineer then created a new build and instructed the user to Save to GitHub to deploy these changes to Vercel. However, the user's very last message noch immer nicht. bitte löse das problem jetzt indicates that the problem persists, and the login functionality for new users is still not working. The AI engineer is now preparing to re-diagnose the problem.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
The next step is to systematically re-debug the user login issue, focusing on why the latest fix (unifying backend URLs in ) did not resolve the problem.
